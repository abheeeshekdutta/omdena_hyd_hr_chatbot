I remember having one little boy as a patient who had a long-term issue resulting in the loss of one of his legs. During the course of his treatments, we discovered we had a mutual love for robot movies. I stayed with him all through his amputation surgery, and when he was fitted with his prosthetic, I was there to cheer him on. We celebrated his first step with his new leg by throwing a robot movie marathon in the common room. His dad pulled me aside that afternoon and told me how grateful the whole family was for all our help and support. It wasn't an easy time for that boy or for his family, but knowing that it was a little easier because I was there and had made a genuine personal connection with them all was humbling and inspiring.",Good

I find it very rewarding to be able to help the patients, as well as their families, be calm and well-prepared for when the doctor can speak with them.",Good
14,Nurse,what do you find rewarding about this job,Conclusion,"I find helping patients through recovery after surgery, which is often one of their greatest challenges, to be most rewarding. Many times, no matter how well-educated the patient is, and how well-prepared they are for what to expect during recovery, the reality of their post-surgical rehabilitation is overwhelming. I once worked with a patient after knee surgery who had some complications, which resulted in the need for an extended hospital stay, and much more physical therapy that she had been prepared for.
I was concerned for her mental state and recommended that she speak with our social worker. After she had been released, she sent me a very nice note, thanking me for putting her in touch with the social worker and letting me know that it had a positive impact on her recovery.",Good
15,Nurse,what do you find rewarding about this job,Conclusion,"I love working with children, and the most rewarding part of being a pediatric nurse is watching how they process their illnesses and injuries, as well as how willing they are to take charge of their recovery.

16,Nurse,tell me what you feel your greatest skill as a nurse is,Conclusion,"I'm very proud of my ability to really listen to what a patient is telling me. Nothing frustrates them more than feeling as though they're not being heard. Having spent the past five years in the medical field working directly with patients has shown me just how far actively listening can go in helping make someone comfortable. During my time working in admissions in my last position, I learned that addressing patient concerns and making sure they felt we were genuinely listened to was just as important as receiving quality care. As a result, I helped to establish a patient advocacy program to help teach other nurses those same listening skills.",Good
17,Nurse,tell me what you feel your greatest skill as a nurse is,Conclusion,"I think the greatest skills in being a nurse is compassion and empathy. The ability to ""walk"" in someone else's shoes is one of the greatest abilities and gift that you can learn, as it will give you depth and insight into extreme caring for others. Compassion and empathy allow you to care for others are a greater depth than just at the surface feelings that we may share with strangers. Compassion and empathy allow you to share your similar experiences with them and to become vulnerable by trusting the relationship you are able to build with them in a short period of time. I feel that this is an extremely important skill because as a nurse you will encounter hundreds, maybe even thousands of patients and their family members across the span of your career and the ability to connect with them is a key to your success in whatever setting you decide to work in.
 
 You will learn a myriad of technical skills along the way that might be useful, fun, or easy to employ during procedures, but the key to nursing is the relationship and trust you build with your patients. These skills will last you your whole career and are applicable outside of your nursing career.",Good

19,Nurse,what's your strongest skill as a nurse,Conclusion,"My strongest skill is to make aware of some dos and don'ts to our patients.

I consider evaluating things around with the same patient case by showing some video case studies about patients just like him or her who'd changed their routines, through this way it can be easy for both of us to deal with the situation efficiently.",Good
20,Nurse,what's your strongest skill as a nurse,Conclusion,My strongest skill is patient education. It can soften fears and improve outcomes. One patient was unable to reduce his blood pressure following a heart attack. I was tasked with helping educate him about diet and exercise.

His blood pressure and lipid profile were all down into a normal range.,Good

34,Nurse,are you comfortable working with other doctors and nurses,Conclusion,"I greatly enjoy working with other staff members â€” working and communicating with other staff members is crucial to providing proper patient care. At my last position, I was supposed to give a patient another dose of his medication. However, I didn't realize that his doctor had changed the dosage until I happened to run into her before heading into the patient's room.

39,Nurse,what's the hardest thing about being a nurse,Introduction,"For me, the hardest thing about nursing is the physical side.

So let me tell you my personal story, in short. I've started as a banker, wanting to earn big, and enjoy luxurious lifestyle. And I did earn well, and could afford nice things. But the more I bought, the bigger void I felt inside. What's more, we were working impossible hours, sometimes up to 90 hours a week, and it really drained me, both physically and emotionally. I decided to change my career, and for once actually do something good for others, instead of just trying to earn more money, on an expense of someone else. I managed to graduate from nursing school, earn my certification, and now I sit here in front of you, looking for a new chapter, for a job with a meaningful purpose. That's my story in short, and I am ready to answer any additional questions you may have.",Good

Before any of it can happen, however, I have to earn my nursing degree, and that's the reason why I sit in front of you today. It is an important milestone on my journey. When it comes to free time, I just enjoy spending quality time with family and friends, and working on my language skills. Currently I am trying to learn Spanish and French.

I would love to work in a school environment, with young people, and that's why I decided to apply for a position of a school nurse with you. It is easy for me to communicate with young people, to gain their trust, and overall it's a better match to my personality. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer, and going out with friends.

What's more, I realize that more people than ever struggle with their mental health, and we need more nurses specializing in the field. That's why I am here with you today, trying to get a chance to study at your school, earn my degree, specialize in mental health nursing, and make a positive difference in lives of others.

85,Nurse,tell me about yourself,Introduction,"I'm a registered nurse with over 10 years of experience in paediatric nursing. Working in healthcare has always been my desire, as I grew up in a home full of healthcare specialists. My mother was an adult nurse, and my father worked as a paediatric oncologist. It was one of his cases that made me think that paediatric nursing was the right field for me. Just before I chose my A-level subjects, my father treated John, a 5-year-old patient whom he diagnosed with bone cancer.
 
 
 
 It was a challenging experience not only for John but also for my family members because my father would tell us about John and how brave he was while undergoing painful treatment. The only thing that bothered my father was that there weren't enough qualified paediatric nurses to support John in between chemotherapy sessions. The thought of that really affected me, and it was what helped me make the decision to go to nursing school. Even now, I'm grateful for that. Helping and supporting children and their families is what I was born to do.",Good

He was angry and argumentative and would often fight with the other nurses over things as little as the temperature of his room. I admit, I wasn't excited when I found out I was going to be working with him, so to prepare, I looked over his charts. I discovered that his wife had died a number of years ago and that he had no friends or family in the area and hadn't had a visitor in ages. Rather than treating him just as a patient, I did my best to connect with him as a human. I would talk to him, not just at him.

The patient called me into the room several times within an hour with various concerns. I sat down with them to ask how they were feeling.
 
 
 
 It turned out that they were worried about their situation and not used to being away from home. I spent a few minutes asking about their pets at home and brought an extra snack before arranging a phone call with their family to help better reassure them.

For example, in one of my last positions, a fellow nurse was regularly late for their shift start. This harmed the transition, causing the team to fall behind. Instead of filing complaints or berating them, I took them aside and asked if they were having challenges getting to work on time.

I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions, which may lead to conflict. When faced with conflict, I work to collaborate with others to resolve the issue in a way that is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Sometimes, I can become defensive when trying to express my opinion.

153,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,"While working on a project for a previous employer, one of my team members regularly challenged every solution I presented. He also had a tendency to interrupt and talk over others without listening to their input. I experienced a challenge in maintaining my patience when he interrupted others without listening. It reached a point where our respective managers counseled both of us on our behavior.
 
 
 
 â€œTo resolve this conflict, I had to recognize that I cannot change or control his behavior. I also acknowledged that this behavior, from both of us, was likely a result of stress due to the heavy workload of the project. Therefore, I adjusted my own communication style to increase empathy, avoid triggers and build patience with interruptions. We were able to complete the project and maintain polite correspondence whenever we needed to work together after that.",Good
154,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,"In my previous experience, I was working with a group to prepare a presentation for leadership. The group was responsible for conceptualizing an idea and presenting a project plan to implement the idea. We selected an idea and developed an action plan for completing the presentation. Two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss the plan and progress. Other team members, including myself, disagreed with this approach because the team had a log to report task progress and completion. 
 
 
 
 â€œAs long as everyone knew their assigned tasks, we did not think we needed to divert time for meetings that would not move the project forward. We also thought these meetings would use valuable time needed to complete the project. Instead of starting an argument about the meetings, we gathered everyone together to explain their reasoning for their side. Eventually, we decided to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes to provide short updates on task progress.",Good
155,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,"When preparing data about the success of past projects to request funding for a new project in our department, a supervisor asked me to delete data records for projects that were less successful. I knew that deleting these records would skew the results and representation of our past performance. I expressed this concern to my supervisor, but she insisted that I remove the data. 
 
 
 
 â€œAfter careful consideration, I decided to discuss the issue with the next level of management, which dismissed my concerns and supported the decision to remove the data. Ultimately, I removed data as directed, but I also changed the language in the report to clearly communicate that the reported data represented successful projects to ensure I accurately represented the information. I also documented the situation, including data records removed from reported results, in the event of questioning or an audit. 
 
 
 
 â€œI understood my supervisor's decision for the request, but I could not compromise my values. I tried to create a compromise in removing the data and adding the language. We did eventually receive funding for our project based on the reports.",Good
156,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,"In one of my previous jobs, the human resources director wanted to capture personal identifying informationâ€”such as social security numbersâ€”on job applications. He was insistent that the information would be secure, and though I believed him, I still disagreed with this practice. I understood that human resources needed to collect this information at the point of hire to verify employment eligibility, but I did not agree with collecting it from every applicant. 
 
 
 
 â€œI expressed my opinion that requiring this information on the application could negatively impact our talent pool, but also acknowledged that I was not a human resources professional and it was not my decision. The human resources director acknowledged my opinion, but believed it was the best practice. I trusted him as the experienced professional to make the correct choice.",Good
157,Nurse,can you describe how you would resolve a conflict with a fellow nurse or healthcare professional,Communication,"Effective communication and professionalism are key in resolving workplace conflicts.

231,Home Health Aide,what are your thoughts on nutrition and diet for home health patients,Communication,"There are a few things to consider when thinking about nutrition and diet for home health patients. The first is that each patient is unique and their individual needs should be taken into account. Some patients may need to be on a special diet due to medical conditions, while others may simply need to eat more nutritious meals. It is important to work with the patient and their doctor to determine what kind of diet will be best for them.
  
  
  
  Another thing to consider is that many home health patients may not be able to cook for themselves or may not have access to healthy food options. This means that it is important to provide meals that are both nutritious and easy to prepare. There are many companies that offer meal delivery services specifically for home health patients, so this is something worth considering.
  
  
  
  Overall, nutrition and diet are important considerations for all home health patients. By working with the patient and their doctor, you can ensure that the patient gets the nutrients they need to stay healthy.",Good

242,Nurse,how do you explain medications treatments or healthcare situations without using a lot of medical or healthcare jargon,Technical,"Patients have different educational backgrounds and understanding of their healthcare and health terms. When I was a home healthcare nurse, many of my patients did not understand specific medical terms. So, I used terminology they understood. Instead of edema, I used swelling. For hypertension, I used high blood pressure. And instead of saying gastroesophageal reflux, I used acid reflux. I made sure they understood what I was saying by asking them to repeat what they heard until they could accurately repeat it in a way that made sense to them.",Good
243,Nurse,can you explain situations without using a lot of medical jargon give an example,Technical,"I have various patients with different educational backgrounds and ages, so I must break medical jargon down into understandable ways. For example, whenever a doctor orders radiology for a patient, I make sure that I explain to the patient they are getting an X-ray. Also, I try to make sure the patient understands by asking them to repeat what they think they heard. That way, everybody is on the same page.Ã¢â‚¬Â",Good
244,Medical Assistant,a time you went beyond and above for a patient,Communication,"I had a patient in my ICU who was riddled with cancer and dying. All he wanted before he died was to sit with his buddies and have some whiskey. I spoke at length to our hospitalist, then to our palliative care MD, and got the order that he could have alcohol. It was heart-warming to walk into that ICU room and see him sitting around, chatting with his buddies and raising a cup.",Average

My motto was if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not god enough for me itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not good enough for them. I wanted the individuals that served to afford the ammenityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in life that you or I could afford meaning if they wanted to go out to a night club and dance why couldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t they I made it happen. If they were going to a prom they wore tuxedoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just anything thrown together We pulled resources together and made it happen. No matter the sweat and work it took if the 8 individuals wanted to see the lights on BeravSquare despite (which I did not know at the time ) thousands of people that were going to be there.

246,Nurse,describe a time a patient was really happy with your care or a time you went above and beyond for a patient,Communication,"I once had a patient who continued to be readmitted to the hospital because of congestive heart failure (CHF). When I came on my shift and started talking with her, I realized she was newly diagnosed with CHF and did not understand the dietary restrictions. So, I took the time to explain what a fluid restriction and no added salt diet was. I wrote everything down and gave her examples of food high in sodium to avoid. Then, I asked the physician to provide her with a referral for a dietary consult while in the hospital. I mentioned that I thought she would benefit from home healthcare when she was discharged. A few months later, she mailed a card to the unit thanking me and letting us know she hadn't been admitted for CHF since she was discharged and was doing well.",Good
247,Nurse,describe a situation when you had to work with a difficult coworker what was the problem and how did you resolve it,Communication,"I had a co-worker who worked the opposite shift of me, who would rush me when she gave report during the handoff. Often, she would only give me partial information about a patient, and sometimes I received no information at all. It was frustrating to me, and it caused tension between us. One day, I came to work ten minutes early. I politely informed her that her handoffs often caused misinformation about our patients. I suggested we do walking rounds so that there was no miscommunication about patients and we didn't miss anything. She agreed that it was a good resolution. That situation taught me how to speak up for myself and confront a problem head-on.",Good
248,Nurse,describe a time you were under a lot of pressure how did you handle it,Communication,"It was my week on call and I was also the staff development nurse. Every day I was called or had to go to the facility to handle an issue. It was really stressful because it felt like I was being pulled in ten different directions. Not only did I have to make sure my job was complete, but I also had to be there when something went wrong or if someone called out. To cut down on the stress and the back and forth, I had each nurse leave me a report. Additionally, I told them I would address any non-emergent issues the following day when I got to work. I decided to get to work about ten minutes early every day to see what I needed to handle from the day before.",Good
249,Nurse,how would you handle a disagreement with a nurse or doctor,Behavioral,"At my previous workplace, there was a nurse who would repeatedly lose her temper with the residents. Other members of the team had confronted her about it previously, but her behavior didn't change. Following one of these incidents, I approached the nurse in question and calmly informed her that her behavior was affecting the well-being of the residents. After explaining to her how her actions negatively affected the people she was responsible for taking care of, she started making an effort to change.",Good
250,Nurse,how would you handle a disagreement with a doctor,Behavioral,"Doctors may handle a lot more patients than nurses. Sometimes it becomes difficult for them to keep track of medical records and patient histories accurately. When there is a discrepancy between a doctor's instructions and a patient's medical records, I discuss the issue in detail with the doctor to get it resolved before we take any further action. When we cannot resolve it, we take a mutual decision to escalate it to a supervisor.",Average
251,Nurse,tell me about a time when a patient's family was dissatisfied with your care how did you handle that situation,Communication,"While I constantly strive to do everything I can for a patient, I had a situation once with a patient who complained to my supervisor about me, telling them I was denying them specific care for an issue. The first thing I have to do in that situation is to step back and really assess what's going on, specifically whether I had acted appropriately. Since I had followed the doctor's orders, I spoke with my supervisor and the attending physician about the situation. It turns out that the patient had misunderstood something the doctor had told her, leading her to assume I was neglecting a step in her care process. Once the confusion was cleared up, we were able to work with the patient to come up with a satisfactory solution",Average
252,Nurse,what is your idea of effective patient and family education,Communication,"Ã¢â‚¬Å“Effective patient education centers around the patient and family's needs. You have to understand their learning style and adapt accordingly. For example, some patients prefer reading medical instructions versus watching a DVD. You also need to figure out what each patient needs. Some want detailed information; others just want the necessary information. Including the family in the treatment process is crucial because they may end up serving as primary caretakers for the patient going forward. Show them how vital they are to the process and key them in on how they can help.Ã¢â‚¬Â",Good
253,Nurse,talk about a time a patient or their family was particularly pleased and appreciative of your care,Communication,"Working in pediatrics can be challenging but also very rewarding. There are times that parents are unable to stay at the bedside 24/7 because of work, other children, or previous commitments. I was taking care of a 6-month-old twin during a specific shift. The family was unable to be at the bedside because the father had to work and the mother was at home with the twin sister and the other children. I spent my shift playing with the infant with age-appropriate toys and when the mother called to check in Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I put the phone next to the infant. The mother was able to hear her baby laughing while singing to her. This brought them closer together and the mother to tears. She stated that no other nurse had done that during the hospitalization and she was eternally grateful.",Good
254,Nurse,describe a time when your facility was undergoing some change how did that impact you and how did you adapt,Communication,"One healthcare system I worked for switched from paper charting to electronic medical records and computerized charting.

256,Nurse,tell me about a time when you didn't know the answer to something at work how did you go about finding the information,Communication,"As nurses, there is no way that we possibly can know everything. Knowing who to go for help is the first step. At the beginning of every shift, I identify a nurse that I can use as a resource such as the charge nurse, nurse educator, or unit resource nurse. This individual is generally someone that is more senior with an advanced skill set. If I am unable to get the answer from them or they are busy I look at the healthcare systems policy and procedure manager. If there is a concern regarding a medication dosage or interaction, I look to Lexi-Comp.",Good
257,Nurse,give me an example of an awkward situation at work how did you remove yourself from the situation,Communication,"I once had a teenage male patient make very inappropriate sexual comments towards me. At first, I ignored them thinking it was a one-time thing. The second time, I told him that the comments were inappropriate and I did not want him to say those things to me. The third time, I left the patient's room and went directly to the charge nurse. I explained the situation and how uncomfortable I was in that specific situation and caring for the patient. She gathered a team to speak to the patient. My assignment was switched for the remainder of the shift",Good
258,Nurse,tell me about a time you failed how did you deal with this situation,Communication,"Failing is one of the worst feelings in the world, either professionally or personally. Working in the ICU setting, patients die. We fail them when this happens. I fail them when this happens. After every death, there is a debriefing to discuss what went well and what could have been done differently. I take that time to reflect on my participation in the event and if there was something I could have done differently. Failure doesn't equal weakness. It simply is something that we must improve upon.",Average
259,Nurse,talk about a time you worked in a fastpaced setting how do you prioritize tasks while maintaining excellent patient care,Communication,"Working in an ICU setting is extremely fast-paced and it is essential to prioritize your tasks for the day. At the beginning of the shift, I make a to-do list with everything that needs to be accomplished. I put the must-do things at the top of the list and the things I would like to do at the bottom. Administering medications are placed at the top of the list and washing a patient's hair is further down. While I would love to accomplish everything, it just isn't possible.",Good
260,Nurse,give an example of an important goal you set for yourself did you accomplish that goal how did you ensure that you accomplished it,Introduction,I set the goal to earn my pediatric certification.

261,Nurse,give an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade a patient to agree to something how did you persuade this person,Communication,"Ideally, we never want to persuade a patient to do something. We would like the patient to agree to it freely. However, I did bargain with a child that if he ate his breakfast I would play video games with him afterward. Using a bargaining system worked well to ensure the patient was well nourished.",Good
262,Nurse,tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to explain yourself to your team or to a patient,Communication,Most hospitals utilize a text feature to relay quick communication to the medical team. It is important to be concise and give all of the important information. This way the medical team can determine the best course of action,Poor
263,Nurse,talk about a time when you had not communicated well how did you correct the situation,Communication,"This often happens when there is a language barrier. I learned that it is always better to ask for an in-person interpreter or utilizing a computer translation software. This ensures there is no miscommunication of information. Unfortunately, hand gestures and speaking louder doesn't always work.",Good
264,Nurse,describe a time when you received negative feedback and turned it into something positive,Communication,"I was once told that I needed to be more social at work and try and bond with my work colleagues. I disagreed with my manager because I felt that we are there to work and take care of our patients, not to make friends. Becoming close friends with coworkers is an added bonus. While I didn't become best friends with anyone from the unit, I was able to spend downtime reading and studying to earn additional certifications which helped me secure better jobs and opportunities in nursing.",Average

266,Nurse,have you ever felt dissatisfied with your work as a nurse what could have been done to make it better,Behavioral,"I once became extremely dissatisfied because I was consistently being given easier assignments and not being given the ICU level patients. It became frustrating and while I understood that others needed to learn and gain experience it quickly left me annoyed with my position, the unit, and the healthcare system. I sat down and spoke to my nurse manager about my concerns and to inquire why it was happening. The nurse manager was not aware of the situation and it was later determined that a few of the charge nurses were giving the sicker patients to their friends and not spreading them out amongst the nurses.",Average
267,Nurse,describe a time when you went over and above your job requirements what motivated you to put forth the extra effort,Communication,"I personally feel like I give 110% to all of my patients every shift but there was one that I grew especially close with. For some reason, the patient had been dropped off by a family member and no one had come to see the child for months. It was obvious the patient was missing key developmental milestones and was becoming increasingly lonely and depressed. I asked to become the primary nurse for the patient which meant every time I worked he would be assigned to me. I worked with him over several months to get him potty trained and to improve his vocabulary. I don't know exactly why I was extra motivated but at that time in our lives, the patient and I needed each other.",Good
268,Nurse,give an example of a mistake you've made how did you handle it,Communication,"Mistakes are part of nursing, whether we like to admit to it or not. It's important to learn from those mistakes and become a better nurse. One mistake that I will never forget is leaving the gastronomy tube unclamped with medication administration. Because it was unclamped when I opened the port to give the next medication, the last medication, as well as formula, came out. I was unable to clamp it quickly enough and the medications I had already given were leaking onto the bed. I had to speak with the medical team and pharmacy to discuss replacing them. I have never forgotten to clamp the gastronomy tube again.",Good

1031,Nurse,what are your strengths,Conclusion,"As a health practitioner, my strengths include adaptability, effective patient communication and a strong work ethic.

Certainly some of them will, and it may impact me negatively in work. But I also know that everyone starts somewhere, and we learn from our mistakes. Nobody leaves the school with ten years of healthcare experienceâ€¦ We all have to gain the experience, often the hard way. Yet I want to assure you that I am eager to learn and motivated to give my very best each and every day at work.",average
