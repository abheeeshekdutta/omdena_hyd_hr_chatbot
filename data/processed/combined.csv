Sales Manager,A specific product hasn't sold well and you have a lot of inventory left over. What strategies do you implement to sell it and earn a profit?,"First, I would look at the placement of the product, move it closer to the front of the store and redesign the display to attract interest from customers.

Sales Manager,Can you describe a time when you had to respond to a problem at work?,"When I’m faced with a challenge at work, I try to rely on data and logic when I’m coming up with my response. As an example, in my last role we saw a sudden decline in our social media engagement. I was tasked with assessing our strategy and identifying where we needed to shift. I analyzed recent performance for our own pages and how our competitors were performing. By researching platform best practices and applying them in a way that was still consistent with our brand, we were able to turn performance around and end the quarter with strong engagement numbers. We learned a lot from that exercise and it confirmed for leadership that more regular analysis of our social media strategy was needed to keep performance strong on those channels.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,Can you describe a time when you led by example?,"I think that oftentimes, the best opportunities to lead by example are all in your attitude. A big pet peeve of mine is actually when people have a bad attitude about work—not that it’s not okay to be frustrated or even to complain sometimes, but I always try to focus on being productive with those feelings.

I immediately conducted a thorough analysis of campaign metrics, audience feedback, and compared it to our initial projections. Identifying that the messaging didn't resonate well with the audience, I organized focus groups and surveys to gather direct feedback.

To use the platform to its fullest capacity, a customer or business had to sign up for a monthly subscription.

Sales Manager,Describe a time you got angry at work.,"I don't typically experience anger at work, but there have been times when I've felt disappointed and frustrated, which I think is normal. For instance, I felt really let down by one of my coworker's lack of communication last December. The holidays are always a really high demand time for everybody, and especially for those of us who work in sales. Unfortunately, my coworker decided at the last minute that she was going to take the two weeks leading up to Christmas off from work. This would've been fine if I knew ahead of time, but she didn't notify me until the day prior, so I couldn't come up with a plan. Overall, her absence made a stressful period even more so for me. I tried my best to meet expectations while she was out, and after the holidays, I spoke with her and directly asked her to make sure she communicates more effectively about her time off so we can avoid similar situations in the future. Thankfully, she was very apologetic and now considers how her absences impact our collective workflow.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,Describe a time you got angry at work.,"I try not to allow myself to get angry at work. Instead, I focus on communicating effectively with other parties and generating solutions that allow me to overcome obstacles successfully. For instance, I recently worked on a research project with a large scope alongside five other contributors. This project necessitated a high level of collaboration and cooperation between me and my teammates. Unfortunately, one of the other contributors seemed to struggle with working as a part of a team and regularly communicated using hostile language. Her resistance to our work started to impact the progress we made toward the project's goals. I decided to invite her to have coffee with me privately and discuss ways to optimize our joint approach. She admitted to me that she prefers to work independently, so I proposed that we break our project into smaller parts so she could make individual contributions instead of shared ones. After having this conversation, our relationship improved significantly, and we've become regular collaborators over the last year.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,Describe how do you handle conflict with coworkers.,"At my previous company, I started working as a content writer just a few weeks after a different content writer, and we quickly became friends. We had similar roles and responsibilities within the company, and we appeared to have similar trajectories with the company. However, I earned a promotion to become a lead writer, causing them to be upset and treat me differently. I asked them to meet with me one on one to discuss my promotion. They said they felt frustrated because they started before me and assumed they would be next to move into a lead writing position. I asked if they wanted my advice about how to earn the promotion in the future, and I shared some tips after they agreed. They thanked me for my feedback and used my feedback to improve their performance, and I recommended them to our manager for a promotion as soon as possible.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,Describe how do you handle conflict with coworkers.,"We had a new client working with our agency, and my manager asked both me and my coworker to prepare pitches for how to approach their marketing campaign with us. We pitched very different concepts, and the client liked certain aspects of both of our campaigns and asked us to work together. My coworker and I felt frustrated with each other because both believed our strategy was the better option to pursue. However, I suggested we work backward through our projects together. We explained our initial ideas to each other, what research we performed and how we chose tactics for the campaign. This helped us find commonalities between our pitches and how to incorporate them to complement one another. As a result, we delivered a campaign that the client loved so much that they set up an auto-renewal contract with us for several more years.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,Describe how do you handle conflict with coworkers.,"In my most recent position as a client support specialist, my coworker and I were responsible for contacting all of our clients to request updated website login information from them to ensure we had accurate information on record. However, we miscommunicated about how to divide up the client list. I thought I would contact clients with names A through M and she would contact clients with names N through Z, and she thought the opposite. As a result, we contacted the same clients, which caused some confusion and clients for our clients. My coworker and I expressed our frustrations with each other, and we both acknowledged that we misheard each other. I suggested implementing a color-coding system to use on a shared spreadsheet for future projects like this one. This new system works well for us, and we haven't had any similar issues since this incident.",Behavioral,Good

Working there taught me how to be able to pivot between independent and collaborative work on a dime.",Introduction,Good
Sales Manager,Do you work well with others?,"In my previous job as a shift manager, I was the leader for a night shift at a 24-hour retail store.

Sales Manager,Has a manager ever given you too much work? What did you do?,"Everyone will have moments in their career where their workload is heavier than normal. I’ve found that this can happen for a lot of reasons and being adaptable can go a long way. A few years ago, one of my colleagues ended up leaving our company for a different opportunity. Naturally, we all had to step up to take on some extra work while waiting on her backfill. I ended up being asked to take on a lot of her administrative work. There were a lot of small things that, especially when added to my existing workload, became too much for me to handle. After giving it my all for a few weeks, I ended up scheduling time with my manager to discuss my bandwidth. We worked together to prioritize my tasks based on our team’s goals and he helped me delegate.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,Have you ever been on a team where someone was not pulling their own weight? How did you handle it?,I think anyone who has ever worked on a team has worked with an underperforming coworker—that’s just par for the course. What I’ve learned is that empathy will take you a long way. I had a coworker in my last role who routinely missed deadlines which would push the rest of our team behind. I decided to sit down with them and try to understand why they were unable to meet project timelines. I learned in that conversation that they hadn’t been properly trained on our project management software and didn’t have a good line of sight into due dates. I was able to help them access training resources and answer some of their questions.,Behavioral,Good

Marketing Manager,How do you decide when to stop investing in a brand strategy and move on to another idea?,"One of the challenges about brand management is that it takes time to solidify a brand, so we may not see the impact of a campaign until it has been running for a while already.

If we fail to meet multiple benchmarks, I would start transitioning away from that project.",Technical,Good
Sales Manager,How do you delegate?,"In my previous position, it was my first time managing a team at work. I quickly learned the value of delegating because I thought I could do it all without help but realized my team members were capable and sharing responsibilities was efficient. I asked my manager to help me find my delegation strategy, so I can use it with my team and found that collaborative delegation works for me. After that, I held a team meeting where we discussed the assignments we needed to complete so we can finish a project by its deadline in two months. We had team members volunteer to work on some assignments together so they could combine their skill sets. Others took tasks in which we knew they were going to be successful. Then we talked about when our check-in dates were going to be as an effort to ensure everyone was on task and following the directions. After they completed their tasks, we all had another meeting to discuss any feedback and give each other recognition for their work.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,How do you delegate?,"I value delegating tasks at work very much because it helps complete assignments quicker.

When I approach them, I ask if they feel comfortable adding another task to their list so I can respect their boundaries. At my first managing job, I had someone share with me they didn't have the space to take on a new task at this moment and I respected their honesty. After that, I went to my next choice of who I thought would do well with the assignment. This allowed both team members to finish their respective tasks on time and do well because they had the proper space and time to complete them. I feel like I'm very good at delegating because I consider my decisions carefully and communicate well with team members.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,How do you determine which features you should add to your product?,"When I'm determining which additions to add to a product, I'll typically start by conducting research on our current users. I'll review insights to determine which features they're currently using the most and will determine what type of updates I can add to make that specific feature more enjoyable for them. Another method I use is reviewing the comments and feedback that users will leave on our software or the input they provide our sales or customer service teams. I'll use these to determine what can be added to enhance they're overall experience.",Technical,Good
Marketing Manager,How do you develop and track the success of a marketing campaign?,"In my experience, I developed marketing campaigns by collabourating with other people on my team.

Last year, I worked with our IT department to implement a communication system for scheduling procedures to ensure that all departments had enough staff members. Our new online scheduling portal increased communication efficiency by 20%. To stay informed about their ongoing concerns, I hold regular meetings with various health care personnel. I've been enjoying that part of my work and I'm especially interested in bringing the experience I've gained to the team at ABC Health.

I also understand that it's important to be fair to others on the team who meet their performance targets, and I want to be able to dedicate my time to the whole group in a productive, equitable manner. Whenever I had to consider terminating an employee in the past, I was always clear with that person about paths to improvement and the consequences of not meeting those goals.

When clients and customers want compensation from a situation that doesn't meet their expectations, it's often challenging to decide how to diffuse the conflict and keep them satisfied. Recently I had a client who insisted on getting a refund, even though their issue was due to their own user error. I had to decide if I wanted to issue the refund so I could attend to a store full of other customers or if I wanted to calm down the customer and explain the issue. While the first option may have saved time, I used my training and asked colleagues to assist with other customers while I deescalated the situation.

I remember having one little boy as a patient who had a long-term issue resulting in the loss of one of his legs.

I stayed with him all through his amputation surgery, and when he was fitted with his prosthetic, I was there to cheer him on.

His dad pulled me aside that afternoon and told me how grateful the whole family was for all our help and support.

Many times, no matter how well-educated the patient is, and how well-prepared they are for what to expect during recovery, the reality of their post-surgical rehabilitation is overwhelming. I once worked with a patient after knee surgery who had some complications, which resulted in the need for an extended hospital stay, and much more physical therapy that she had been prepared for.

Nurse,tell me about yourself,"I'm a registered nurse with over 10 years of experience in paediatric nursing. Working in healthcare has always been my desire, as I grew up in a home full of healthcare specialists. My mother was an adult nurse, and my father worked as a paediatric oncologist. It was one of his cases that made me think that paediatric nursing was the right field for me. Just before I chose my A-level subjects, my father treated John, a 5-year-old patient whom he diagnosed with bone cancer.
 
 
 
 It was a challenging experience not only for John but also for my family members because my father would tell us about John and how brave he was while undergoing painful treatment. The only thing that bothered my father was that there weren't enough qualified paediatric nurses to support John in between chemotherapy sessions. The thought of that really affected me, and it was what helped me make the decision to go to nursing school. Even now, I'm grateful for that. Helping and supporting children and their families is what I was born to do.",Introduction,Good

I admit, I wasn't excited when I found out I was going to be working with him, so to prepare, I looked over his charts. I discovered that his wife had died a number of years ago and that he had no friends or family in the area and hadn't had a visitor in ages.

I spent a few minutes asking about their pets at home and brought an extra snack before arranging a phone call with their family to help better reassure them.

It reached a point where our respective managers counseled both of us on our behavior.
 
 
 
 â€œTo resolve this conflict, I had to recognize that I cannot change or control his behavior. I also acknowledged that this behavior, from both of us, was likely a result of stress due to the heavy workload of the project.

Other team members, including myself, disagreed with this approach because the team had a log to report task progress and completion. 
 
 
 
 â€œAs long as everyone knew their assigned tasks, we did not think we needed to divert time for meetings that would not move the project forward. We also thought these meetings would use valuable time needed to complete the project.

Ultimately, I removed data as directed, but I also changed the language in the report to clearly communicate that the reported data represented successful projects to ensure I accurately represented the information. I also documented the situation, including data records removed from reported results, in the event of questioning or an audit.

Nurse,how do you explain medications treatments or healthcare situations without using a lot of medical or healthcare jargon,"Patients have different educational backgrounds and understanding of their healthcare and health terms. When I was a home healthcare nurse, many of my patients did not understand specific medical terms. So, I used terminology they understood. Instead of edema, I used swelling. For hypertension, I used high blood pressure. And instead of saying gastroesophageal reflux, I used acid reflux. I made sure they understood what I was saying by asking them to repeat what they heard until they could accurately repeat it in a way that made sense to them.",Technical,Good
Nurse,can you explain situations without using a lot of medical jargon give an example,"I have various patients with different educational backgrounds and ages, so I must break medical jargon down into understandable ways. For example, whenever a doctor orders radiology for a patient, I make sure that I explain to the patient they are getting an X-ray. Also, I try to make sure the patient understands by asking them to repeat what they think they heard. That way, everybody is on the same page.Ã¢â‚¬Â",Technical,Good
Medical Assistant,a time you went beyond and above for a patient,"I had a patient in my ICU who was riddled with cancer and dying. All he wanted before he died was to sit with his buddies and have some whiskey. I spoke at length to our hospitalist, then to our palliative care MD, and got the order that he could have alcohol. It was heart-warming to walk into that ICU room and see him sitting around, chatting with his buddies and raising a cup.",Communication,Average
Nurse,describe a time you went above and beyond for a patient or customer describe a time you needed help with your duties how did you approach the situation describe a time you had to deal with a problem at work how did you handle it,"There are so many times. My motto was if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not god enough for me itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not good enough for them. I wanted the individuals that served to afford the ammenityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in life that you or I could afford meaning if they wanted to go out to a night club and dance why couldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t they I made it happen. If they were going to a prom they wore tuxedoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just anything thrown together We pulled resources together and made it happen. No matter the sweat and work it took if the 8 individuals wanted to see the lights on BeravSquare despite (which I did not know at the time ) thousands of people that were going to be there. We went suffered through the traffic to park and get 8 individuals (with wheel chairs, and a dog) out to experience 10 minutes of Fire works but you know it was worth to be able to feel the cold air and be amongst hundreds of people they were happy and I was happy. Less",Communication,Average
Nurse,describe a time a patient was really happy with your care or a time you went above and beyond for a patient,"I once had a patient who continued to be readmitted to the hospital because of congestive heart failure (CHF). When I came on my shift and started talking with her, I realized she was newly diagnosed with CHF and did not understand the dietary restrictions. So, I took the time to explain what a fluid restriction and no added salt diet was. I wrote everything down and gave her examples of food high in sodium to avoid. Then, I asked the physician to provide her with a referral for a dietary consult while in the hospital. I mentioned that I thought she would benefit from home healthcare when she was discharged. A few months later, she mailed a card to the unit thanking me and letting us know she hadn't been admitted for CHF since she was discharged and was doing well.",Communication,Good
Nurse,describe a situation when you had to work with a difficult coworker what was the problem and how did you resolve it,"I had a co-worker who worked the opposite shift of me, who would rush me when she gave report during the handoff. Often, she would only give me partial information about a patient, and sometimes I received no information at all. It was frustrating to me, and it caused tension between us. One day, I came to work ten minutes early. I politely informed her that her handoffs often caused misinformation about our patients. I suggested we do walking rounds so that there was no miscommunication about patients and we didn't miss anything. She agreed that it was a good resolution. That situation taught me how to speak up for myself and confront a problem head-on.",Communication,Good
Nurse,describe a time you were under a lot of pressure how did you handle it,"It was my week on call and I was also the staff development nurse. Every day I was called or had to go to the facility to handle an issue. It was really stressful because it felt like I was being pulled in ten different directions. Not only did I have to make sure my job was complete, but I also had to be there when something went wrong or if someone called out. To cut down on the stress and the back and forth, I had each nurse leave me a report. Additionally, I told them I would address any non-emergent issues the following day when I got to work. I decided to get to work about ten minutes early every day to see what I needed to handle from the day before.",Communication,Good
Nurse,how would you handle a disagreement with a nurse or doctor,"At my previous workplace, there was a nurse who would repeatedly lose her temper with the residents. Other members of the team had confronted her about it previously, but her behavior didn't change. Following one of these incidents, I approached the nurse in question and calmly informed her that her behavior was affecting the well-being of the residents. After explaining to her how her actions negatively affected the people she was responsible for taking care of, she started making an effort to change.",Behavioral,Good
Nurse,how would you handle a disagreement with a doctor,"Doctors may handle a lot more patients than nurses. Sometimes it becomes difficult for them to keep track of medical records and patient histories accurately. When there is a discrepancy between a doctor's instructions and a patient's medical records, I discuss the issue in detail with the doctor to get it resolved before we take any further action. When we cannot resolve it, we take a mutual decision to escalate it to a supervisor.",Behavioral,Average
Nurse,tell me about a time when a patient's family was dissatisfied with your care how did you handle that situation,"While I constantly strive to do everything I can for a patient, I had a situation once with a patient who complained to my supervisor about me, telling them I was denying them specific care for an issue. The first thing I have to do in that situation is to step back and really assess what's going on, specifically whether I had acted appropriately. Since I had followed the doctor's orders, I spoke with my supervisor and the attending physician about the situation. It turns out that the patient had misunderstood something the doctor had told her, leading her to assume I was neglecting a step in her care process. Once the confusion was cleared up, we were able to work with the patient to come up with a satisfactory solution",Communication,Average
Nurse,what is your idea of effective patient and family education,"Ã¢â‚¬Å“Effective patient education centers around the patient and family's needs. You have to understand their learning style and adapt accordingly. For example, some patients prefer reading medical instructions versus watching a DVD. You also need to figure out what each patient needs. Some want detailed information; others just want the necessary information. Including the family in the treatment process is crucial because they may end up serving as primary caretakers for the patient going forward. Show them how vital they are to the process and key them in on how they can help.Ã¢â‚¬Â",Communication,Good
Nurse,talk about a time a patient or their family was particularly pleased and appreciative of your care,"Working in pediatrics can be challenging but also very rewarding. There are times that parents are unable to stay at the bedside 24/7 because of work, other children, or previous commitments. I was taking care of a 6-month-old twin during a specific shift. The family was unable to be at the bedside because the father had to work and the mother was at home with the twin sister and the other children. I spent my shift playing with the infant with age-appropriate toys and when the mother called to check in Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I put the phone next to the infant. The mother was able to hear her baby laughing while singing to her. This brought them closer together and the mother to tears. She stated that no other nurse had done that during the hospitalization and she was eternally grateful.",Communication,Good
Nurse,describe a time when your facility was undergoing some change how did that impact you and how did you adapt,"One healthcare system I worked for switched from paper charting to electronic medical records and computerized charting. During this transition, it was confusing and often overwhelming. I was able to adapt quickly but unfortunately, some of my coworkers were not able to.",Communication,Poor
Nurse,What do you do when you donâ€™t know the answer to something at work whether itâ€™s how to address a situation or the answer to a patient question,"When I don't understand something at work, I seek out help. I don't let my pride get in the way of quality patient care. I generally ask someone who has more experience than me to help out and do it in a timely manner.Ã¢â‚¬Â",Technical,Average
Nurse,tell me about a time when you didn't know the answer to something at work how did you go about finding the information,"As nurses, there is no way that we possibly can know everything. Knowing who to go for help is the first step. At the beginning of every shift, I identify a nurse that I can use as a resource such as the charge nurse, nurse educator, or unit resource nurse. This individual is generally someone that is more senior with an advanced skill set. If I am unable to get the answer from them or they are busy I look at the healthcare systems policy and procedure manager. If there is a concern regarding a medication dosage or interaction, I look to Lexi-Comp.",Communication,Good
Nurse,give me an example of an awkward situation at work how did you remove yourself from the situation,"I once had a teenage male patient make very inappropriate sexual comments towards me. At first, I ignored them thinking it was a one-time thing. The second time, I told him that the comments were inappropriate and I did not want him to say those things to me. The third time, I left the patient's room and went directly to the charge nurse. I explained the situation and how uncomfortable I was in that specific situation and caring for the patient. She gathered a team to speak to the patient. My assignment was switched for the remainder of the shift",Communication,Good
Nurse,tell me about a time you failed how did you deal with this situation,"Failing is one of the worst feelings in the world, either professionally or personally. Working in the ICU setting, patients die. We fail them when this happens. I fail them when this happens. After every death, there is a debriefing to discuss what went well and what could have been done differently. I take that time to reflect on my participation in the event and if there was something I could have done differently. Failure doesn't equal weakness. It simply is something that we must improve upon.",Communication,Average
Nurse,talk about a time you worked in a fastpaced setting how do you prioritize tasks while maintaining excellent patient care,"Working in an ICU setting is extremely fast-paced and it is essential to prioritize your tasks for the day. At the beginning of the shift, I make a to-do list with everything that needs to be accomplished. I put the must-do things at the top of the list and the things I would like to do at the bottom. Administering medications are placed at the top of the list and washing a patient's hair is further down. While I would love to accomplish everything, it just isn't possible.",Communication,Good
Nurse,give an example of an important goal you set for yourself did you accomplish that goal how did you ensure that you accomplished it,I set the goal to earn my pediatric certification. I made a list of things that must be done to achieve that. I signed up for the exam and paid the fee so that way I had to take the exam. There was no backing out.,Introduction,Good
Nurse,give an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade a patient to agree to something how did you persuade this person,"Ideally, we never want to persuade a patient to do something. We would like the patient to agree to it freely. However, I did bargain with a child that if he ate his breakfast I would play video games with him afterward. Using a bargaining system worked well to ensure the patient was well nourished.",Communication,Good
Nurse,tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to explain yourself to your team or to a patient,Most hospitals utilize a text feature to relay quick communication to the medical team. It is important to be concise and give all of the important information. This way the medical team can determine the best course of action,Communication,Poor
Nurse,talk about a time when you had not communicated well how did you correct the situation,"This often happens when there is a language barrier. I learned that it is always better to ask for an in-person interpreter or utilizing a computer translation software. This ensures there is no miscommunication of information. Unfortunately, hand gestures and speaking louder doesn't always work.",Communication,Good
Nurse,describe a time when you received negative feedback and turned it into something positive,"I was once told that I needed to be more social at work and try and bond with my work colleagues. I disagreed with my manager because I felt that we are there to work and take care of our patients, not to make friends. Becoming close friends with coworkers is an added bonus. While I didn't become best friends with anyone from the unit, I was able to spend downtime reading and studying to earn additional certifications which helped me secure better jobs and opportunities in nursing.",Communication,Average
Nurse,what is one professional accomplishment that you are most proud of and why,Earning my advanced pediatric certification is something I worked very hard for and something that validates the years I have spent at the bedside,Conclusion,Average
Nurse,have you ever felt dissatisfied with your work as a nurse what could have been done to make it better,"I once became extremely dissatisfied because I was consistently being given easier assignments and not being given the ICU level patients. It became frustrating and while I understood that others needed to learn and gain experience it quickly left me annoyed with my position, the unit, and the healthcare system. I sat down and spoke to my nurse manager about my concerns and to inquire why it was happening. The nurse manager was not aware of the situation and it was later determined that a few of the charge nurses were giving the sicker patients to their friends and not spreading them out amongst the nurses.",Behavioral,Average
Nurse,describe a time when you went over and above your job requirements what motivated you to put forth the extra effort,"I personally feel like I give 110% to all of my patients every shift but there was one that I grew especially close with. For some reason, the patient had been dropped off by a family member and no one had come to see the child for months. It was obvious the patient was missing key developmental milestones and was becoming increasingly lonely and depressed. I asked to become the primary nurse for the patient which meant every time I worked he would be assigned to me. I worked with him over several months to get him potty trained and to improve his vocabulary. I don't know exactly why I was extra motivated but at that time in our lives, the patient and I needed each other.",Communication,Good
Nurse,give an example of a mistake you've made how did you handle it,"Mistakes are part of nursing, whether we like to admit to it or not. It's important to learn from those mistakes and become a better nurse. One mistake that I will never forget is leaving the gastronomy tube unclamped with medication administration. Because it was unclamped when I opened the port to give the next medication, the last medication, as well as formula, came out. I was unable to clamp it quickly enough and the medications I had already given were leaking onto the bed. I had to speak with the medical team and pharmacy to discuss replacing them. I have never forgotten to clamp the gastronomy tube again.",Communication,Good
Nurse and Midwife,what makes you stand out from other nurse midwives,"I believe my experience and dedication to the field of nurse midwifery makes me stand out from other nurse midwives.

For example, when I dealt with an unsatisfied customer that was really angry and was ready to give a negative review about our product. Instead of feeling stressed, I concentrated on finding out what her challenge was exactly and looked for ways to help her get the problem solved addressing it to the right channel. My ability to remain calm when dealing with the unsatisfied customer reduced my stress and the stress that the customer may face”. For me, communication is key to a stressful situation. Many times I communicate as much as possible to make sure that I am on the same page with everyone involved in what I am working on. It reduces errors and cuts down stress to a very large extent. In my previous job, I was working on a project with another team and found out that after a while we had a different approach on the same project. I called for a stand-up meeting so that we can come to a logical conclusion and carry on with the project. At the end of the day, we agreed on one vision and the project went on successfully”.",General,Good
Customer Service Representative,How do you plan to ensure you complete a number of tasks effectively?,"No matter the number of tasks I have to complete, I always calm down first and figure the best way to go about completing the task.

If I am experiencing any challenge working on any of the tasks, I don’t hesitate to ask a professional for assistance”. Whenever I have multiple tasks to complete, I, first, of all, maintain a positive mindset on the whole task and avoid getting frustrated. I then come up with a plan to carry out the task and meet up with the set deadline. And if I cannot meet up with the set deadline I would politely ask for an extension”.",General,Average

I also get interested in what they do and show concern about their interest and goals, then we can communicate on a more shared ground”. I build an interpersonal relationship with my team members by building interest around what they do.

I was known to be the eagle’s eye of my team”.",General,Good

Customer Service Representative,Tell Me About a Time You Assisted a Customer Who’d Worked With Multiple Agents and Didn’t Get the Help They Needed.,"In my current role, my company doesn’t allow calls to be transferred between support reps on the same level, only up the chain to managers or to different departments. However, if this came up, I know that I would want to do everything I could to be the one to solve the customer’s issue and avoid transferring them again. First, I would try to get all of the information possible from the transferring rep. Second, I would ask the customer if they could tell me about the issue again in their own words. The goal would be to identify whether there was any miscommunication. If there was, I’d follow the standard steps based on this new information. If not, I would go back to the very basic details—things as simple as verifying the customer’s address is correct and their billing address matches their current address—to ensure we weren’t missing anything. If I needed to go to someone else for assistance, I would try to keep the customer on my line if at all possible while I got the information I needed. That way I could advocate for them and they could feel like someone was really on their side in helping to solve their problem.”",Situational,Good
